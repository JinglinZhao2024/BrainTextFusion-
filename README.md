# UACF: Unified Adaptive Convergence Framework for AI-Driven Text Classification

## Introduction
The convergence of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with **Industry 4.0** applications is unlocking new possibilities for **advanced text classification**. This project introduces **UACF (Unified Adaptive Convergence Framework)**, a novel approach that bridges:
- **Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs)**
- **Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs)**
- **Neuroscience Research**

UACF integrates **multi-modal feature extraction, cross-domain reasoning, and adaptive optimization** to enhance text classification in industrial settings. By leveraging **dynamic multi-domain adaptation strategies**, the framework improves **scalability, generalization, and robustness** across diverse industrial applications.

## Features
- **Multi-Modal Feature Extraction**: Integrates data from multiple sources, including textual, neural, and interactive inputs.
- **Cross-Domain Reasoning**: Enhances adaptability across different industrial and research domains.
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Dynamically prioritizes tasks based on feedback-driven mechanisms.
- **Scalability & Robustness**: Ensures high performance across large-scale Industry 4.0 applications.
- **LLM-Enhanced Text Classification**: Utilizes the latest advancements in large language models.
